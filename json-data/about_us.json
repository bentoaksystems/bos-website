  "description": "\n \n # Bent Oak Systems \n was founded in summer 2016 in London, UK. \n\nAt the time we were a few Iranian professionals working for big international corporates and every time we met we had some exciting idea about a new app. But we lacked \n the production line \n for the ideas, and the contractors we found were either expensive or low-quality (and in both cases: not affordable).\n\nWe decided to create the production line. Amin had the right motives and opportunities to move back to Iran and create the team, and after a few months we had a team.\n\n # Our ideals are:\n\n 1. To have a strong presence in Iran to help in actualising the potentials in this environment.\n\n2. To get involved in technology education as it helps us to be an agent of growth in the environmant, and also find talents and become known to them, that in turn helps us to thrive.\n3. To use best of breed of technologies for each purpose, particularly to use more productive and 'connected' ways of software production.\n4. To focus on software quality - though we can be agile and deliver the results, our preference is to deliver high quality, well-thought, well-designed and extensively-tested code.\n\nOur team nurtured on these ideals and strives to achieve them.\n"
